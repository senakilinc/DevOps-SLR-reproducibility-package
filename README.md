# Systematic Literature Review for DevOps
This package provides the necessary details that would allow anyone to reproduce the systematic literature review (SLR) of DevOps
definitions, principles and practices that was performed in May 2022 as part of a semester project for the degree of Bachelor in Computer Science at the
University of Luxembourg by Sena Kılınç under the supervision of Dr. Alfredo Capozucca.
# How to use?
Please find the folder called Search Strings to have access to the search strings that have been used to conduct the systematic literature review with their respective Digital Libraries: IEEE Xplore, ACM and SCOPUS. The search strings have been applied using advanced search.

# Tool Support
Mendeley

Mendeley is a free reference manager
and allows the user to store, organize and search all their
references from just one library. The software can be also
be used to highlight excerpts containing potential DevOps
concepts.

Note that Mendeley
has limitations on space, however it could still ease the process of
managing references after eliminating some references by
performing the study selection and data extraction steps of
a review.
